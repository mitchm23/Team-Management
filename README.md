This is an application designed to help manage a database of employees by using SQL to access the data of Departments, Employees, and Employee roles.

I haven't been able to get MySQL to work on my computer until recently, so I have been dramatically behind on this unit. As such, there are a number of things that I need to fix and add to this project.

First, I need to  figure out how to properly insert my test values in mySQL just so I can be certain that the tables are actually working.

Next, in conjunction with that, I'll make sure the methods that I have, which are all of the view methods, properly return the queries, so that I know the "SELECT" stuff is doing what it is supposed to do.

Finally, I'll learn how I can insert responses from Inquirer to create my own additions to the tables inside of the terminal.

I'll present my problems in office hours to hopefully clear it up, and if that doesn't push me in the right direction, I'll ask my tutor for some assistance.
